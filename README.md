# Stock_VBA

Overview: The dataset contains data from 4 different quarters. The data itself contains the date and month and the name of companies. It shows the price of stocks when the market open and the price of when it closes. It also shows the highest price adn lowest price of the stock during the day. It also shows the volume of how many shares were traded.

I created a VBA script that tracks percent change of the price. Along with total stock volume adn quarterly change. It also has the data from the companies that has the greatest and lowest percent change and teh greatest volume change. Resources I used to help write my code is Instructor Drew's speedrun. I also used Excel VBA Cheat Sheet to help me stucture my code. I also used Excel Macro Mastery to help me better understand VBA.
